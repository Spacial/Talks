Secure Coding 

ðŸ‘‰SAST should be run early in the SDLC. The test reveals vulnerabilities in the code, specifically those in the OWASP Top 10 like SQL injection.
ðŸ‘‰SCA with composition analysis scans software, and its dependencies display a list of known vulns and notes any deprecated dependencies.
ðŸ‘‰Secure Code Review is a specialized task involving manual/auto review of an app source code to identify security-related code.

Build and Test

ðŸ‘‰Container and Image Scan checks the build process of your containers and images for vulns. 
ðŸ‘‰DAST for compiled code / a running app without knowledge of the environment, simulating an attack. 
ðŸ‘‰Fuzzing the unexpected inputs. It should test if a non-date is entered in a date field or drop a binary file in a text field. 
ðŸ‘‰An IAST tests the running apps for vulns during use, similar to a DAST. Can identify the line of code that is the source of a particular exposure.

Delivery and Deploy

ðŸ‘‰Sign Verifies both the signature of the code and that the code has not been tampered with. 
ðŸ‘‰Artifacts and Image Repository Scan all the artifacts created during development for vulnerabilities, and an image repository scan images when they are pushed to a repository. 

Run Defense

ðŸ‘‰Monitoring systems, containers, and networks for known vulnerabilities with observability tools.
ðŸ‘‰RASP works by adding sensors into the code so that execution points watch for exploits happening in real-time.
ðŸ‘‰Attack simulation can be done either black box or white and on the apps, services, systems, networks, etc.
